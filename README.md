# ChatBot_seq2seq
This repo is my initial work on a conversational chatbot using seq2seq.

Implemented by following this tutorial : http://suriyadeepan.github.io/2016-12-31-practical-seq2seq/

https://github.com/suriyadeepan/practical_seq2seq --> code borrowed and modified to work with tensorflow v0.12.1 

interface.py : uses the pre-trained model to communicate.
